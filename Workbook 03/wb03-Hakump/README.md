### Notes for the grader: 
The quadcopter:
1. add new one that will fly to where the mouse click, it will first adjust the position for next move
2. when press space, the copter will shoot a "missile" to where the mouse is on.
3. the missile has Proximity fuze, so it will also explode when if approach the target copter (one that move around a circle)
4. The light will blink, if the object is moving, it blinks faster
